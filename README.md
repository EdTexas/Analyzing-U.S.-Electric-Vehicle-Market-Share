# Introduction
This project takes a look at the makeup of the different alternative fuel types for cars registered in the United States while taking a deeper look at EV registration across the states. Data was validated in Excel, then visualized in Tableau using custom calculated fields to produce percentage-based insights. This project also answered several questions. First, where does EV adoption thrive and where does it lag behind. Second, what fuel alternatives are actually being adopted versus which are not. Lastly, where should policy makers place their EV investments to increase utilization of EV vehicles.

# Background
Here in late 2025, about 10-12% of all new car sales in the U.S are EVs and while the need for cleaner fuel alternatives is very real, policymakers need clear insights from which to base their decisions on when looking to increase EV adoption. Which areas of the country should we focus our investments? How can we increase EV adoption in our lowest ranking states? These are the questions this project was put together to answer.

# Analysis

### 1. What percentage of vehicles in each state are EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and gasoline?

Summary of Findings:  
Rhode Island leads states on percentage of gas vehicles at over 89% and California leads states in EV and hybrid adoption at over 9%.

### 2. Which alternative fuels (biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen) are significant vs. niche?

Summary of Findings:  
By looking at these percentages its clear gas is still king, however its market share is slowly being eaten up by alternatives, primarily EVs. There are other prominent alternatives as well, notably ethanol and biodiesel which combine to over eight percent. Natural gas (CNG), propane, hydrogen, and methanol remain niche with their combined make up being barely a hundredth of a percent. 

### 3. Which states have the highest EV adoption rates, and which states lag behind?

Summary of Findings:  
When looking at our leading states for EV adoption we should really focus at California at the number one spot. Not just because they sit over 3% EVs but also because California has the highest population by far. Mississippi and West Virginia on the other hand are in the bottom five in EV adoption. This may be tied to both states being bottom two on 2024 census for average household income.

### 4. Where should policymakers prioritize EV infrastructure investment based on adoption trends and gaps in support?

Summary of Findings:  
Based off what we found in our data, policy makers would be best served by invested in CA, TX, and NY. Not just because these are our largest states, but the household income in these states is also at or above the national average according to the 2024 census. Some routes to take would be increasing EV charging infrastructure, raising awareness for the environmental benefits, and implementing new tax or financial incentives to buy EVs instead of Gasoline. 

# Conclusion

This analysis helps viewers understand what alternative fuel types are beginning to become prominent in the U.S. and which ones remain niche. While some states are excelling in EV adoption like California, many other states are still in the initial phases of adoption. These trends spotlight the need for targeted infrastructure investment, policy action, and education to accelerate EV and alternative fuel growth, especially in states where the potential for adoption remains untapped.
